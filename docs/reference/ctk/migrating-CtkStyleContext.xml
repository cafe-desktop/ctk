  <title>Theming changes</title>

  <para>
    In CTK+ 3.0, #CtkStyleContext was added to replace #CtkStyle and
    the theming infrastructure available in 2.x. CtkStyleContext is an
    object similar in spirit to CtkStyle, as it contains theming information,
    although in a more complete and tokenized fashion. There are two aspects
    to switching to CtkStyleContext: porting themes and theme engines, and
    porting applications, libraries and widgets.

  <section id="ctk-migrating-CtkStyleContext-themes">

    <para>
      From CTK+ 3.0 on, theme engines must implement #CtkThemingEngine and be
      installed in <filename>$libdir/ctk+-3.0/$CTK_VERSION/theming-engines</filename>,
      and the files containing style information must be written in the CSS-like
      format that is understood by #CtkCssProvider. For a theme named
      "Clearlooks", the CSS file parsed by default is
      <filename>$datadir/themes/Clearlooks/ctk-3.0/ctk.css</filename>,
      with possible variants such as the dark theme being named
      <filename>ctk-dark.css</filename> in the same directory.
    </para>

    <para>
      If your theme RC file was providing values for #CtkSettings, you
      can install a <filename>settings.ini</filename> keyfile along with
      the <filename>ctk.css</filename> to provide theme-specific defaults
      for settings.
    </para>

    <para>
      Key themes have been converted to CSS syntax too. See the
      <link linkend="css-binding-set">CtkCssProvider</link> documentation
      information about the syntax. CTK+ looks for key themes in the file
      <filename>$datadir/themes/<replaceable>theme</replaceable>/ctk-3.0/ctk-keys.css</filename>, where <replaceable>theme</replaceable> is the current
      key theme name.

    <title>Migrating theme engines</title>

    <para>
      Migrating a #CtkStyle based engine to a #CtkThemingEngine based one
      should be straightforward for most of the vfuncs. Besides a cleanup
      in the available paint methods and a simplification in the passed
      arguments (in favor of #CtkStyleContext containing all the information),
      the available render methods resemble those of #CtkStyle quite
      evidently. Notable differences include:
    </para>

    <orderedlist>
      <listitem>
        All variations of ctk_paint_box(), ctk_paint_flat_box(),
        ctk_paint_shadow(), ctk_paint_box_gap() and ctk_paint_shadow_gap()
        are replaced by ctk_render_background(), ctk_render_frame() and
        ctk_render_frame_gap(). The first function renders frameless
        backgrounds and the last two render frames in various forms.
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        ctk_paint_resize_grip() has been subsumed by ctk_render_handle()
        with a #CTK_STYLE_CLASS_GRIP class set in the style context.
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        ctk_paint_spinner() disappears in favor of ctk_render_activity()
        with a #CTK_STYLE_CLASS_SPINNER class set in the style context.
      </listitem>
    </orderedlist>

    <para>
      The list of available render methods is:
    </para>

    <simplelist>
      <member>
        ctk_render_background(): Renders a widget/area background.
      </member>
      <member>
        ctk_render_frame(): Renders a frame border around the given rectangle.
        Usually the detail of the border depends on the theme information,
        plus the current widget state.
      </member>
      <member>
        ctk_render_frame_gap(): Renders a frame border with a gap on one side.
      </member>
      <member>
        ctk_render_layout(): Renders a #PangoLayout.
      </member>
      <member>
        ctk_render_handle(): Renders all kind of handles and resize grips,
        depending on the style class.
      </member>
      <member>
        ctk_render_check(): Render checkboxes.
      </member>
      <member>
        ctk_render_option(): Render radiobuttons.
      </member>
      <member>
        ctk_render_arrow(): Renders an arrow pointing to a direction.
      </member>
      <member>
        ctk_render_expander(): Renders an expander indicator, such as in
        #CtkExpander.
      </member>
      <member>
        ctk_render_focus(): Renders the indication that a widget has the
        keyboard focus.
      </member>
      <member>
        ctk_render_line(): Renders a line from one coordinate to another.
      </member>
      <member>
        ctk_render_slider(): Renders a slider, such as in #CtkScale.
      </member>
      <member>
        ctk_render_extension(): Renders an extension that protrudes from
        a UI element, such as a notebook tab.
      </member>
      <member>
        ctk_render_activity(): Renders an area displaying activity, be it
        a progressbar or a spinner.
      </member>
      <member>
        ctk_render_icon_pixbuf(): Renders an icon into a #GdkPixbuf.
      </member>
    </simplelist>

    <para>
      One of the main differences to #CtkStyle<!-- -->-based engines is that the
      rendered widget is totally isolated from the theme engine, all style
      information is meant to be retrieved from the #CtkThemingEngine API,
      or from the #CtkWidgetPath obtained from ctk_theming_engine_get_path(),
      which fully represents the rendered widget's hierarchy from a styling
      point of view.
    </para>

    <para>
      The detail string available in #CtkStyle<!-- -->-based engines has been
      replaced by widget regions and style classes. Regions are a way for
      complex widgets to associate different styles with different areas,
      such as even and odd rows in a treeview. Style classes allow sharing
      of style information between widgets, regardless of their type.
      Regions and style classes can be used in style sheets to associate
      styles, and them engines can also access them. There are several
      predefined classes and regions such as %CTK_STYLE_CLASS_BUTTON or
      %CTK_STYLE_REGION_TAB in <filename>ctkstylecontext.h</filename>,
      although custom widgets may define their own, which themes may
      attempt to handle.
    </para>

  </section>

  <section id="ctk-migrating-CtkStyleContext-parser-extensions">
    <title>Extending the CSS parser</title>

    <para>
      In #CtkStyle<!-- -->-based engines, CtkRCStyle provided ways to extend the
      ctkrc parser with engine-specific extensions. This has been replaced
      by ctk_theming_engine_register_property(), which lets a theme engine
      register new properties with an arbitrary type. While there is built-in
      support for most basic types, it is possible to use a custom parser
      for the property.
    </para>

    <para>
      The installed properties depend on the #CtkThemingEngine:name property,
      so they should be added in the <literal>constructed()</literal> vfunc.
      For example, if an engine with the name "Clearlooks" installs a
      "focus-color" property with the type #GdkRGBA, the property
      <literal>-Clearlooks-focus-color</literal> will be registered and
      accepted in CSS like this:
      <informalexample><programlisting>
      CtkEntry {
        -Clearlooks-focus-color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1.0);
      }
      </programlisting></informalexample>
    </para>

    <para>
      Widget style properties also follow a similar syntax, with the widget
      type name used as a prefix. For example, the #CtkWidget focus-line-width
      style property can be modified in CSS as
      <literal>-CtkWidget-focus-line-width</literal>.
    </para>
  </section>

  <section id="ctk-migrating-CtkStyleContext-css">
    <title>Using the CSS file format</title>

    <para>
      The syntax of RC and CSS files formats is obviously different.
      The CSS-like syntax will hopefully be much more familiar to many
      people, lowering the barrier for custom theming.
    </para>
    <para>
      Instead of going through the syntax differences one-by-one, we
      will present a more or less comprehensive example and discuss
      how it can be translated into CSS:
    </para>

    <example>

                base[PRELIGHT]    = shade (0.95, @bg_color)
                base[SELECTED]    = @selected_bg_color
                base[INSENSITIVE] = @bg_color
                base[ACTIVE]      = shade (0.9, @selected_bg_color)

                engine "clearlooks" {
                        colorize_scrollbar = TRUE
                        style = CLASSIC
                }
        }

        style "tooltips" {
                xthickness = 4

                bg[NORMAL]        = @tooltip_bg_color
                fg[NORMAL]        = @tooltip_fg_color
        }

        style "button" {
                xthickness = 3
                ythickness = 3

                engine "clearlooks" {

        widget_class "window-name.*.CtkButton" style "other"
      </programlisting>
    </example>

    <para>
      would roughly translate to this CSS:
    </para>

    <example>
      <title>CSS translation</title>
      <programlisting>
        * {
          padding: 1;
          -CtkButton-child-displacement-x: 1;
          -CtkButton-child-displacement-y: 1;
          -CtkCheckButton-indicator-size: 14;

          background-color: @bg_color;
          color: @fg_color;

          -Clearlooks-colorize-scrollbar: true;
          -Clearlooks-style: classic;
        }

        *:hover {
          background-color: shade (@bg_color, 1.02);
        }

        *:selected {
          background-color: @selected_bg_color;
          color: @selected_fg_color;
        }

        *:insensitive {
          color: shade (@bg_color, 0.7);
        }

        *:active {
          background-color: shade (@bg_color, 0.9);
        }

        .tooltip {
          padding: 4;

          background-color: @tooltip_bg_color;
          color: @tooltip_fg_color;
        }

        .button {
          padding: 3;
          background-color: shade (@bg_color, 1.04);
        }

        .button:hover {
          background-color: shade (@bg_color, 1.06);
        }

        .button:active {
          background-color: shade (@bg_color, 0.85);
        }

        .entry {
          padding: 3;

          background-color: @base_color;
          color: @text_color;
        }

        .entry:selected {
          background-color: mix (@selected_bg_color, @base_color, 0.4);
          -Clearlooks-focus-color: shade (0.65, @selected_bg_color)
        }

        /* The latter selector is an specification of the first,
           since any widget may use the same classes or names */
        &num;window-name .button,
        CtkWindow&num;window-name CtkButton.button {
          background-color: &num;fff;
        }
      </programlisting>
    </example>

    <para>
      One notable difference is the reduction from fg/bg/text/base colors
      to only foreground/background, in exchange the widget is able to render
      its various elements with different CSS classes, which can be themed
      independently.
    </para>

    <para>
      In the same vein, the light, dark and mid color variants that
      were available in CtkStyle should be replaced by a combination of
      symbolic colors and custom CSS, where necessary. text_aa should
      really not be used anywhere, anyway, and the white and black colors
      that were available in CtkStyle can just be replaced by literal
      GdkRGBA structs.
    </para>

    <para>
      Access to colors has also changed a bit. With #CtkStyle, the common
      way to access colors is:
      <informalexample><programlisting>
      GdkColor *color1;
      GdkColor color2;

      color1 = &amp;style->bg[CTK_STATE_PRELIGHT];
      ctk_style_lookup_color (style, "focus_color", &amp;color2);
      </programlisting></informalexample>
      With #CtkStyleContext, you generally use #GdkRGBA instead of #GdkColor
      and the code looks like this:
      <informalexample><programlisting>
      GdkRGBA *color1;
      GdkRGBA  color2;

      ctk_style_context_get (context, CTK_STATE_FLAG_PRELIGHT,
                             "background-color", &amp;color1,
                             NULL);
      ctk_style_context_lookup_color (context, "focus_color", &amp;color2);

      ...

      gdk_rgba_free (color1);
      </programlisting></informalexample>
      Note that the memory handling here is different: ctk_style_context_get()
      expects the address of a GdkRGBA* and returns a newly allocated struct,
      ctk_style_context_lookup_color() expects the address of an existing
      struct, and fills it.
    </para>

    <para>
      It is worth mentioning that the new file format does not support
      stock icon mappings as the RC format did.
    </para>
  </section>

  <section id="ctk-migrating-CtkStyleContext-checklist">
    <title>A checklist for widgets</title>

    <para>
      When porting your widgets to use #CtkStyleContext, this checklist
      might be useful.
    </para>

    <orderedlist>
      <listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>
          Try to identify the role of what you're rendering with any number
          of classes. This will replace the detail string. There is a predefined
          set of CSS classes which you can reuse where appropriate. Doing so
          will give you theming 'for free', whereas custom classes will require
          extra work in the theme. Note that complex widgets are likely to
          need different styles when rendering different parts, and style
          classes are one way to achieve this. This could result in code like
          the following (simplified) examples:
        </para>

        <example>
          <title>Setting a permanent CSS class</title>

          </programlisting>
        </example>

        <para>
          Note that #CtkStyleContext only provides fg/bg colors, so text/base
          is done through distinctive theming of the different classes. For
          example, an entry would usually be black on white while a button
          would usually be black on light grey.

          The most distinctive changes are the use of #CtkStateFlags to
          represent the widget state and the lack of #CtkShadowType. Note
          that widget state is now passed implicitly via the context, so
          to render in a certain state, you have to temporarily set the
          state on the context, as in the following example:
        </para>
        <example>
          <title>Rendering with a specific state</title>
          <programlisting>
            ctk_style_context_save (context);
            ctk_style_context_set_state (context, CTK_STATE_FLAG_ACTIVE);
            ctk_render_check (context, cr, x, y, width, height);
            ctk_style_context_restore (context);
          </programlisting>
        </example>
        <para>
          For ctk_render_check() and ctk_render_option(), the @shadow_type
          parameter is replaced by the #CTK_STATE_FLAG_ACTIVE and
          #CTK_STATE_FLAG_INCONSISTENT state flags. For things such as
          pressed/unpressed button states, #CTK_STATE_FLAG_ACTIVE is used,
          and the CSS may style normal/active states differently to render
          outset/inset borders, respectively.

        The various <literal>ctk_widget_modify_*()</literal> functions to
        override colors or fonts for individual widgets have been replaced
        by similar <literal>ctk_widget_override_*()</literal> functions.

        It is no longer necessary to call ctk_widget_style_attach(),
        ctk_style_attach(), ctk_style_detach() or ctk_widget_ensure_style().
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        Replace all uses of xthickness/ythickness. #CtkStyleContext uses the
        CSS box model, and there are border-width/padding/margin properties to
        replace the different applications of X and Y thickness. Note that all
        of this is merely a guideline. Widgets may choose to follow it or not.

      As a consequence of the RC format going away, calling ctk_rc_parse() or
      ctk_rc_parse_string() won't have any effect on a widgets appearance.
      The way to replace these calls is using a custom #CtkStyleProvider,
      either for an individual widget through ctk_style_context_add_provider()
      or for all widgets on a screen through ctk_style_context_add_provider_for_screen().
      Typically, the provider will be a #CtkCssProvider, which parse CSS
      information from a file or from a string.
    </para>
    <example>
      <title>Using a custom CtkStyleProvider</title>
      <programlisting>
        CtkStyleContext *context;
        CtkCssProvider *provider;

        context = ctk_widget_get_style_context (widget);
        provider = ctk_css_provider_new ();
        ctk_css_provider_load_from_data (CTK_CSS_PROVIDER (provider),
                                         ".frame1 {\n"
                                         "   border-image: url('gradient1.png') 10 10 10 10 stretch;\n"
                                         "}\n", -1, NULL);
        ctk_style_context_add_provider (context,
                                        CTK_STYLE_PROVIDER (provider),
                                        CTK_STYLE_PROVIDER_PRIORITY_APPLICATION);
        g_object_unref (provider);
      </programlisting>
    </example>
    <para>
      Notice that you can also get style information from custom resources
      by implementing the #CtkStyleProvider interface yourself. This is
      an advanced feature that should be rarely used.

    <para>
      There are some features in #CtkStyleContext that were not available in
      #CtkStyle, or were made available over time for certain widgets through
      extending the detail string in obscure ways. There is a lot more
      information available when rendering UI elements, and it is accessible
      in more uniform, less hacky ways. By going through this list you'll
      ensure your widget is a good citizen in a fully themable user interface.

        If your widget renders a series of similar elements, such as tabs
        in a #CtkNotebook or rows/column in a #CtkTreeView, consider adding
        regions through ctk_style_context_add_region(). These regions can be
        referenced in CSS and the :nth-child pseudo-class may be used to match
        the elements depending on the flags passed.

        <example>
          <title>Theming widget regions</title>
          <programlisting>
            CtkNotebook tab {
              background-color: &num;f3329d;
            }

            CtkTreeView row::nth-child (even) {
              background-color: &num;dddddd;
            }

      <listitem>
        <para>
          If your container renders child widgets within different regions,
          make it implement #CtkContainer get_path_for_child(<!-- -->). This function
          lets containers assign a special #CtkWidgetPath to child widgets
          depending on their role/region. This is necessary to extend the
          concept above throughout the widget hierarchy.
        </para>

        <para>
          For example, a #CtkNotebook modifies the tab labels' #CtkWidgetPath
          so the "tab" region is added. This makes it possible to theme tab
          labels through:

          <title>Theming a widget within a parent container region</title>

            CtkNotebook tab CtkLabel {
              font: Sans 8;

      <listitem>
        If you intend several visual elements to look interconnected,
        make sure you specify rendered elements' connection areas with
        ctk_style_context_set_junction_sides(). It is of course up to the
        theme to make use of this information or not.

          #CtkStyleContext supports implicit animations on state changes for
          the most simple case out-of-the-box: widgets with a single animatable
          area, whose state is changed with ctk_widget_set_state_flags() or
          ctk_widget_unset_state_flags(). These functions trigger animated
          transitions for the affected state flags. Examples of widgets for
          which this kind of animation may be sufficient are #CtkButton or
          #CtkEntry.
        </para>
        <para>
          If your widget consists of more than a simple area, and these areas
          may be rendered with different states, make sure to mark the rendered
          areas with ctk_style_context_push_animatable_region() and
          ctk_style_context_pop_animatable_region().
        </para>

        <para>
          ctk_style_context_notify_state_change() may be used to trigger a
          transition for a given state. The region ID will determine the
          animatable region that is affected by this transition.
