Migrating from GTK+3 to CTK
===========================

1. You need to rename a lot of code,
   first the file/folder names, and later the code itself,
   maybe using a script to make the job quikly:

gtk -> ctk
GTK -> CTK
Gtk -> Ctk

gdk -> cdk
GDK -> CDK
Gdk -> Cdk

GAIL -> CAIL
gail -> cail
Gail -> Cail 

2. CTK can build with GTK-Doc, if you have related code, you must rename:

ctk-doc -> gtk-doc
ctk_doc -> gtk_doc
CTK-Doc -> GTK-Doc
ctkdoc -> gtkdoc
CTKDOC -> GTKDOC
CTK_DOC -> GTK_DOC

3. CTK can build with GdkPixbuf, if you have related code, you must rename:

cdkpixbuf -> gdkpixbuf
cdk-pixbuf -> gdk-pixbuf
CdkPixbuf -> GdkPixbuf
cdk_pixbuf -> gdk_pixbuf
CDK-Pixbuf -> GDK-Pixbuf
CDK_PIXBUF -> GDK_PIXBUF
CDKPIXBUF -> GDKPIXBUF
CDK_INTERP_BILINEAR -> GDK_INTERP_BILINEAR
CDK_INTERP_HYPER -> GDK_INTERP_HYPER
CDK_INTERP_NEAREST -> GDK_INTERP_NEAREST
CDK_INTERP_TILES -> GDK_INTERP_TILES
CdkInterpType -> GdkInterpType
CDK_COLORSPACE_RGB -> GDK_COLORSPACE_RGB
CDK_TYPE_PIXBUF -> GDK_TYPE_PIXBUF
CDK_IS_PIXBUF -> GDK_IS_PIXBUF

4. After all the process, maybe some translations are affected, you can check and rename:

ctk-dok -> gtk-dok

5. To improve the look, you need to have a ctk theme installed, for example:
   https://github.com/cafe-desktop/cafe-themes

6. If your project requires it, you can port now to them, already ported to ctk:

   vte fork using ctk: https://github.com/cafe-desktop/bte

   gtksourceview fork using ctk: https://github.com/cafe-desktop/ctksourceview

   libpeas fork using ctk: https://github.com/cafe-desktop/libbean

   libcanberra fork using ctk: https://github.com/cafe-desktop/libkanberra

   libwnck fork using ctk: https://github.com/cafe-desktop/libvnck
