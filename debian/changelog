gtk+3.0 (3.24.24-4) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Add various patches from upstream 3.24.25 to 3.24.29, mostly
    crash fixes:
    - d/p/gdkpixbuf-drawable-Free-the-pixbuf-on-Cairo-error.patch:
      Fix a memory leak when a Cairo error occurs
    - d/p/Wayland-ignore-touch-tablet-events-on-destroyed-surfaces.patch:
      Fix crashes if input events are received on a recently-closed window
      or menu
    - d/p/label-Skip-updating-link-state-if-we-have-no-layout.patch:
      Fix crash if a GtkLabel's activate-link handler changes the
      label's markup
    - d/p/x11-dnd-Ignore-XErrors-from-the-COW.patch:
      Adds a missing error trap to prevent crashes in X11 drag & drop.
      The X11 functions called here cannot normally fail, but it seems
      they can fail in certain configurations of the NVIDIA proprietary
      driver. (LP: #1911036)
    - d/p/cssshadowvalue-Apply-device-scale-to-the-offset-when-blur.patch:
      Apply scale factor to blurred shadows.
      In particular this makes the desktop-icons-ng GNOME Shell extension,
      as used in Ubuntu 21.04, display correctly on HiDPI displays.
      (LP: #1919404)
    - d/p/scale-Fix-sporadic-criticals.patch:
      Fix a possible crash due to use-after-free
    - d/p/fontchooser-Fix-some-since-annotations.patch:
      Correct documentation
    - d/p/x11-Be-quiet-on-exit-by-default.patch:
      Don't spam the system log when disconnected from the X11 display
    - d/p/Fix-a-possible-crash-in-gtk_show_uri.patch:
      Don't crash if asked to display a URI that doesn't have a useful
      basename
    - d/p/x11-Don-t-beep-on-untrusted-displays.patch:
      Don't beep if connected to an X11 display that distrusts the
      application (ssh -X -oForwardX11Trusted=no), which can result in a
      fatal error
    - d/p/placesview-Open-location-even-if-mount-was-not-found.patch:
      Fix inability to display SMB server's list of shares
      (e.g. smb://192.168.1.1/) in Nautilus
  * d/p/updateiconcache-Sort-list-of-entries.patch:
    Mark as applied upstream to GTK 3 as well as to GTK 4

gtk+3.0 (3.24.24-2) unstable; urgency=medium

  * d/watch: Cope with "+" being escaped to "%2B" in links to tarballs
  * Increase dependency on librsvg2-common from Suggests to Recommends.
    This is not a hard dependency, but should be installed in nearly all
    cases. Increasingly many icons are provided in SVG format, so
    applications will appear broken if the SVG pixbuf loader is not
    installed. See #980396 for more information.
    adwaita-icon-theme already Recommends librsvg2-common, but people who
    routinely do not install recommended packages will get a better hint
    about how much will be broken by its removal if GTK also recommends it.

      (Closes: #955820, we hope)

    - When using the "simple" input method context, load the same compose
      sequences for Wayland as for X11 (in order of preference:

    Drop patch. Build-depend on gdk-pixbuf 2.40 instead of working around
    a bug in older versions.
  * d/rules: Mark some reftests as allowed to fail.
    These reftests are sensitive to the build environment (exact versions
    of Pango, fonts etc.) and are disabled in upstream's CI.
    (Closes: #954584)
  * d/p/updateiconcache-Sort-list-of-entries.patch:
    Backport patch from GTK 4 to make the icon cache reproducible
    (Closes: #953105)
  * d/p/build-Generate-gdk.gresource.xml-in-sorted-order.patch:
    Sort GDK resources to improve reproducibility.

    Replace patches above with an upstreamable version
  * Use debhelper-compat 12
    - Don't explicitly use dh_makeshlibs -V, it is now the default
    - Don't explicitly use --libexecdir=/usr/libexec, it is now the default
    - Don't try to use dh_missing on debian/install/udeb if we didn't do
      the udeb build
  * API documentation:
    - Install documentation in /usr/share/gtk-doc, with symlinks in /u/s/doc.
      gtk-doc documentation is technically a functional interface
      (Policy §12.3), because other packages can build-depend on it and
      use it to fix cross-references.
    - Install symlinks to gtk-doc in both /usr/share/doc/libgtk-3-doc
      (traditional location) and /usr/share/doc/libgtk-3-dev ("main package"
      for developer documentation, as recommended in Policy §12.3)
  * Refer to GTK rather than GTK+ in packaging files.
    The library was renamed in February 2019.

    - d/p/gdk-Generate-gdkenumtypes.-ch-in-the-builddir.patch,

  * d/p/Revert-Update-some-a11y-test-results.patch:

  * d/p/docs-Add-gtk_file_chooser_add_choice-and-related-function.patch,
    d/p/Fix-a-string-leak.patch:
    Add post-release fixes from upstream gtk-3-24 branch
  * d/p/Disable-accessibility-dump-aka-a11ytests-test.patch:
    Disable accessibility-dump test (aka a11ytests).
    It works by comparing a dump of the a11y widget tree with a known-good
    version, but that seems to vary unpredictably according to some unknown
    factor. Upstream's CI currently disables all the a11y tests, so we can't
    expect this to be reliable.
  * Remove another generated file
  * d/libgail-3-0.symbols: Add Build-Depends-Package
  * d/libgail-3-doc.doc-base.gail-reference: Use /usr/share/doc paths

gtk+3.0 (3.20.5-2) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Split gtk-update-icon-cache utility out of libgtk-3-bin into a separate
    package called gtk-update-icon-cache to break a dependency cycle with
    adwaita-icon-theme when building the package. (Closes: #824999)
    As the gtk-update-icon-cache binary doesn't actually have any libgtk-3-0
    dependency, there is no longer a reason to ship a gtk2 and gtk3 variant.
    So from now on we will only ship one implementation built from src:gtk+3.0
    and drop the Debian specific -3.0 suffix. To simplify the transition make
    libgtk-3-bin depend on gtk-update-icon-cache. Once all theme packages have
    been updated, this dependency can be dropped.

gtk+3.0 (3.2.2-3) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Martin Pitt ]
  * Add 000git_gtk_tree_view_get_tooltip_context_annotation.patch: Fix
    gtk_tree_view_get_tooltip_context() transfer annotation, causing crashes
    when using this method from Python.
  * Add 016_no_offscreen_widgets_grabbing.patch: Widgets inside
    GtkOffscreenWindow seem like they should not be allowed to do
    grab the mouse or whatever, as this can deactivate open menus.
    (LP: #512427, GNOME #607668)
  * Add 017_no_offscreen_device_grabbing.patch: Do not allow devices in an
    offscreen hierarchy to take grabs. (LP: #804009, GNOME #658563)
  * Add 018_gdkenumtypes.c_location.patch: Always generate gdk/gdkenumtypes.c
    in the source tree, and fix path in the introspection sources. With this,
    gdkenumtypes.c is correctly included with separate build trees, too.  This
    fixes missing GTypes in the .gir when using a separate build tree.
    (LP: #769256, GNOME #647729)
  * debian/rules: Bump SHVER to 3.1.90.
  * Build for multiarch. Adapted Steve Langasek's changes to Ubuntu's gtk+2.0
    package:
    - debian/control.in: Bump build dependencies to multiarch aware versions.
    - debian/control.in: Add Multi-Arch: and necessary Pre-Depends: fields.
      (libraries/-dbg are "same", -doc/-bin are "foreign").
    - debian/rules: Use multiarch LIBDIR.
    - debian/libgail-3-dev.install, debian/libgail-3-0.install: Rename to
      *.in, and use @LIBDIR@ instead of hardcoded usr/lib.
    - debian/gir1.2-gtk-3.0.install.in: Use @LIBDIR@.
    - debian/libgtk-3-0.triggers.in, debian/libgtk-3-0.postinst.in,
      debian/rules: Also trigger on changes to the fallback non-multiarch
      module directory, which is now called @OLD_MODULES_BASE_PATH@.
    - Add 061_multiarch_module_fallback.patch: Fall back to the hard-coded
      pre-multiarch module directory when searching for modules. This
      maintains compatibility with packages installing modules to
      the old directories.

  [ Josselin Mouette ]
  * Break murrine-themes (same reason as gnome-themes-standard).
  * Move /etc/gtk-3.0 to libgtk-3-common.
  * Add appropriate Breaks/Replaces to handle it.
  * Remove gtk-query-immodules-3.0 from libgtk-3-bin since it is
    clearly not Multi-Arch compatible. It should not be needed anyway,
    everything is handled by triggers from the private directory.
  * Remove incorrect M-A: same statement for the debug package.
  * Make libgtk-3-bin arch-any, thanks Rico for noticing.

  [ Michael Biebl ]
  * debian/libgtk-3-0.postinst.in: If the non-multiarch immodules directory
    does not exist or is empty handle this case more gracefully and don't
    print an error message.
  * debian/patches/080_filechooserdefault-Don-t-unref-value-twice.patch: Fix
    incorrect ref counting which could lead to a crash in the filechooser.

  [ Cyril Brulebois ]
  * Switch udeb from DirectFB to Xlib to prepare the move to an X11-based
    graphical installer. Closes: #573872.
     - Replace libgtk-directfb-2.0-0-udeb with libgtk-x11-udeb in control
       file.
     - Update description accordingly.
     - Update .install.in accordingly, using the “shared_udeb” flavour,
       based on the “shared” one, but with a few X11 extensions disabled.
     - Update package name and file paths accordingly in rules file.
  * Version/Bump some B-D to make sure the udeb gets proper dependencies
    on the recently reworked/added udebs:
     - libx11-dev
     - libxcursor-dev
     - libxext-dev
     - libxi-dev
     - libxinerama-dev
     - libxrender-dev
  * Add one patch to make it possible to disable X11 extensions, and
    refresh the other one accordingly:
     - 005_support_disabling_x11_extensions.patch
     - 070_mandatory-relibtoolize.patch
  * Ship a minimal MIME database in the udeb, since the loaders mechanism
    isn’t sufficient to get proper PNG support:
     - Add shared-mime-info to Build-Depends to ensure that the
       update-mime-database tool is available at build-time, as well as
       the source freedesktop.org.xml file.
     - Add debian/keep-png-only.xsl to only keep the mime-type matching
       type="image/png". Matching with namespaces is tricky, see the
       comments in the XSL file for the details.
     - Build a MIME cache, and only ship the resulting mime.cache file
       under /usr/share/mime in the udeb.
     - While this is dirty, that should do the trick until it is needed
       for shared-mime-info to ship its own udeb.

  [ Emilio Pozuelo Monfort ]
  * Rename the udeb to libgtk2.0-0-udeb.
  * Standards-Version is 3.8.4, no changes needed.

      + Define a default OPTLIBDIR and replace it in the sed foo for %.in

        %.in; the %.opt file is optional and only included if the opt flavor
        is included.
      + Add a debian/libgtk2.0-0.install.opt which lists files from the
        optimised flavor to install in libgtk2.0-0.

  [ Loic Minier ]
  * Flip back gdkpixbuf_module_files_d_str after gdkpixbuf_module_file_str in
    patch 021_loader-files-d; this fixes config of gdk loaders and hence the
    current ia32-libs implementation; the change in 2.12.0-3 was incorrect in
    that it flipped the order for im modules and pixbuf loaders, but only im
    modules had to be flipped; the reason im modules had to be flipped is that
    the first list of modules wins for im modules as there is some duplicate
    checking, while in the case of gdk pixbufs, the last file wins.  What
    remains to be done here is:
    - biarch support, similar to pango, by loading /usr/lib32 and /usr/lib64
      stuff before /usr/lib; allows dropping the config file hack in
      ia32-libs.
    - loading of modules from multiarch locations (not multiarch); allows
      dropping the config file hack in ia32-libs.
  * Bump build-deps and libgtk2.0-dev's deps to ensure we get Xorg dev

  [ Loic Minier ]
  * Fix broken second dh_strip invocation which was not only acting on the

  * Update patch 021_loader-files-d to use PIXBUF_FILES_LIBDIR which is
    defined in gdk-pixbuf/Makefile.am, similarly to PIXBUF_LIBDIR, and based
    on the newly defined loaderfilesdir, similar to loaderdir; update
    070_mandatory-relibtoolize.
  * New patch, 022_module-files-append-compat-module-files-d, prefer
    /usr/lib32/gtk-2.0/<gtk-binary-version>/loader-files.d and
    /immodule-files.d over the /usr/lib/.../*.d pathnames added in
    020_immodules-files-d and 021_loader-files-d when available; this is
    useful for ia32-libs support; other modules might need additional support
    depending on how they are loaded, for example GTK_MODULES will probably
    still be looked up below libdir, as well as engines, printbackends,
    filesystems, and generic modules.  See also Ubuntu #205223 and #190227 for

  * Define the flags for each flavor (shared, static, and udeb) in Makefile
    vars and share the common flags.
  * Only pass --host to configure if DEB_HOST_GNU_TYPE and DEB_BUILD_GNU_TYPE
    differ.
  * Stop shipping *.la and *.a files of modules (all module types).
  * Move GTK_BINARY_VERSION back to rules.
  * Use GTK_BINVER_DEP instead of BINVER.
  * Build flavors out-of-tree; saves 25% of required build space (315 MB) and
    some build time / IO load; this clutters the headers a little (full build
    path is mentionned instead of ".") though.
  * Rewrite and cleanup the build process completely.
  * Install the full set of pkg-config files from the dfb flavor in
    /usr/lib/pkgconfig/libgtk-directfb-2.0; to use this feature, set
    PKG_CONFIG_PATH while invoking pkg-config (or configure); the
    /usr/lib/pkgconfig/*directfb*.pc files will be removed when Debian sources
    have been converted.
  * In the same spirit, gdkconfig.h is in /usr/lib/gtk-2.0/include/directfb;
    to use it, prepend -I/usr/lib/gtk-2.0/include/directfb to CFLAGS.

    suggesting them.
  * Rewrite update-gdkpixbuf-loaders and update-gtk-immodules.
  * Drop double libatk1.0-dev build-dep.
  * Empty the dependency_libs in the *.la files of libgtk2.0-dev.
  * New immodule files handling with *.immodules files below
    /usr/lib/gtk-2.0/<BINARY_VERSION>/immodule-files.d.
    - New patch, 020_immodules-files-d, to split the module search path on
      ":", as is done in Pango, prepend
      /usr/lib/gtk-2.0/<BINARY_VERSION>/immodule-files.d to the search path,
      and to read all *.immodules files when a directory is encountered in the
      search path.
    - Pre-generate
      /usr/lib/gtk-2.0/<BINARY_VERSION>/immodule-files.d/libgtk2.0-0.immodules
      for the shared library.
    - Continue generating /etc/gtk-2.0/gtk.immodules until packages are
      updated.
  * Add the libpixmap engine to the udeb for the new Bladr GTK theme for g-i.
  * New loader files handling with *.loaders files below
    /usr/lib/gtk-2.0/<BINARY_VERSION>/loaders-files.d.
    - New patch, 021_loader-files-d, to split the module search path on
      ":", as is done in Pango, prepend
      /usr/lib/gtk-2.0/<BINARY_VERSION>/loader-files.d to the search path,
      and to read all *.loaders files when a directory is encountered in the

    - Pre-generate
      /usr/lib/gtk-2.0/<BINARY_VERSION>/loader-files.d/libgtk2.0-0.loaders
      for the shared library and libgtk-directfb-2.0-0-udeb.loaders for the
      udeb.
    - Continue generating /etc/gtk-2.0/gdk-pixbuf.loaders until packages are
      updated.
    - This particular patch uses two ugly workarounds and needs work before
      being sent upstream.
  * New Debhelper-based command, dh_gtkmodules, to create module files for IM
    modules and GdkPixbuf loaders; it will still add a dependency on the
    binary version of Gtk for other modules.
  * Make use of the new dh_gtkmodules during the build (override the path to
    gtk-query-immodules-2.0 and gdk-pixbuf-query-loaders.
  * Add ${misc:Depends} to gtk2-engines-pixbuf.

gtk+2.0 (2.8.1-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New upstream version:
    - gtk-update-icon-cache no longer stores copies of symlinked icons,
      and it has a --index-only option to omit image data from the cache.
    - Make large GtkSizeGroups more efficient.
    - Improve positioning of menus in GtkToolbar.
    - Make scrolling work on unrealized icon views.
    - Avoid unnecessary redraws on range widgets.
    - Make sure that all GTK+ applications reload icon themes promptly.
    - Ensure that gdk_pango_get_context() and gtk_widget_get_pango_context()
      use the same font options and dpi value.
    - Multiple memory leak fixes.
  * debian/control.in:
    - updated the libgtk2.0-dev Depends according to the changes.
  * debian/rules:
    Add --enable-explicit-deps=yes to make sure stuff like x11 gets listed as a
    Requires: in gdk(-x11)-2.0.pc, because otherwise linkage against -lX11 and
    friends doesn't get carried through.  Whether or not this is correct is
    arguable, since libgdk-x11-2.0.so.0* ends up linked against it anyway, but
    stuff like gnome-panel seems to be relying on this transience.
