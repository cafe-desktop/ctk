Prerequisites
=============

CTK+ requires the following packages:

 - The GLib, Pango, GdkPixbuf, ATK and cairo libraries, available at
   the same location as CTK+. CTK+ @CTK_VERSION@ requires at least
   GLib @GLIB_REQUIRED_VERSION@, Pango @PANGO_REQUIRED_VERSION@,
   GdkPixbuf @GDK_PIXBUF_REQUIRED_VERSION@, ATK @ATK_REQUIRED_VERSION@
   and cairo @CAIRO_REQUIRED_VERSION@.

 - libepoxy, for cross-platform OpenGL support.
   It can be found here: https://github.com/anholt/libepoxy

 - Each GDK backend has its own backend-specific requirements. For
   the X11 backend, X11 R6 and XInput version 2 (as well as a number
   of other extensions) are required. The Wayland backend requires
   (obviously) the Wayland libraries.

 - gobject-introspection @INTROSPECTION_REQUIRED_VERSION@ or newer.

Simple install procedure
========================

  % tar xf ctk+-@CTK_VERSION@.tar.xz          # unpack the sources
  % cd ctk+-@CTK_VERSION@                     # change to the toplevel directory
  % ./configure                        # run the `configure' script
  % make                               # build CTK+
  [ Become root if necessary ]
  % make install                       # install CTK+
